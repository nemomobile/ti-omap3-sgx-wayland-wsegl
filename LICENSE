Licensing:

See wayland-egl.c/wayland-egl-priv.h -- Basic wayland-egl implementation

wayland-egl-priv.h, waylandwsegl.c: If a native display is NULL, it wants
the framebuffer. Collect information on pixel format and other framebuffer
properties and store in egl display structure.

Method:

https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/4.7/src/plugins/gfxdrivers/powervr/QWSWSEGL/pvrqwsdrawable.c

wayland-egl-priv.h, waylandwsegl.c: Making a window drawable, if native window is NULL, we want the
framebuffer. Collect information on flipbuffer availiability. Return
rotation angle and re-use egldisplay as drawable handle.

Method: 

See
https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/4.7/src/plugins/gfxdrivers/powervr/QWSWSEGL/pvrqwsdrawable.c
lines 216-220 for flipbuffer availability code. Return rotation angle,

----

wayland-egl-priv.h, waylandwsegl.c: Drawables need something to draw into.
To get frames to display, there's two methods, flip chains (note that you
want a change in frames to happen) or blitting (blit onto a front buffer).
This sets up back buffering structures and flip chains. 

Method:

See
https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/4.7/src/plugins/gfxdrivers/powervr/QWSWSEGL/pvrqwsdrawable.c 
lines 665-696 for allocation of back buffers and general logic, lines
241-248 for getting memory handle for framebuffer (front buffer) and lines
258-273 for flip chain allocation. Stride is 32 in that source code, but as per
http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Render_to_Texture_with_OpenGL_ES#Stride
we can save memory and only have 8 on SGX rev 121. Pixel width in bytes is
based on RGB565/ARGB8888 definitions.

Licensing:

See Qt licensing, for rest, contribution by Carsten Munk <carsten@maemo.org>

----

wayland-egl-priv.h, waylandwsegl.c: To start rendering the SGX drivers need
information on buffers and do buffer swapping.


Method:

See
https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/4.7/src/plugins/gfxdrivers/powervr/QWSWSEGL/pvrqwsdrawable.c
lines 720-730 for buffer swapping,
https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/4.7/src/plugins/gfxdrivers/powervr/QWSWSEGL/pvrqwswsegl.c
lines 336-379 for information passing.

Licensing:

---

wayland-egl-priv.h, waylandwsegl.c: Implement blitting and present flip for
flipchains.

Method:

See
https://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt/blobs/4.7/src/plugins/gfxdrivers/powervr/QWSWSEGL/pvrqwsdrawable.c

Method:

waylandwsegl.c: Handle deleting drawables

---
waylandwsegl.c: Share hardware buffers with DRM object through a handle.  

Method:

We are using MemExport in xserver-xorg-video-fbdev for SGX, which gives us a
memory handle which is passed on to DRI clients. pvr2d.h. In this, I use
PVR2DMemExport to get a shared memory handle for my hardware buffer.

--- 

waylandwsegl.c, wayland-egl-priv.h, wayland-egl.c: Make way to differentiate
between different drawable types

Method:

Just a simple header for the internal structures.

Licensing:

LGPLv2.1, Contribution by Carsten Munk <carsten@maemo.org>

----

waylandwsegl.c: Add swap buffering for wayland windows/DRM buffers

Method:

Basically just logic seen in mesa already, protocol for attaching buffers to
wayland windows

Seen in http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/gallium/state_trackers/egl/wayland/native_wayland.c
lines 253-294

Licensing:

See Mesa licensing.

---

waylandwsegl.c: If we get a specially crafted pixmap (pixmap drawables) that contains a DRM
handle, we map it into space and use it as a pixmap.

Method:

The inverse of a PVR2DMemExport is logically a PVR2DMemMap (and takes a
PVR2D_HANDLE too). We make a fake pixmap structure for internal usage and
map in the buffer into our memory space/SGX contexts. When render
information is requested, we can pass the memory information to the SGX
drivers.
