This is a proof of concept Wayland WSEGL, which enables the use of SGX
hardware buffers as pixmaps, effectively making wayland available on SGX
devices.

To use it, you want to do something like this:
- mv /usr/lib/libEGL.so /usr/lib/libEGL-sgx.so
- install the libEGl "proxy" (it'll send calls to libEGL-sgx.so, and do some extra
  lifting for wayland)
- install the wsegl plugin
- edit /etc/powervr.ini, adding the following to the [default] section:
  WindowSystem=/usr/lib/waylandwsegl.so

Make sure you have X and anything using X killed off.

To test it, you'll want to run e.g. qml-compositor with something like this:
    cd /usr/lib/qt5/examples/qtwayland/qml-compositor/
    QT_QPA_EGLFS_DEPTH=16 QT_COMPOSITOR_NEGATE_INVERTED_Y=1 ./qml-compositor -platform eglfs

And you can then run clients like this:
    QT_QPA_EGLFS_DEPTH=16 QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1 /usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmlscene -platform wayland test.qml

Debugging:
WAYLAND_DEBUG=1
WSEGL_DEBUG=5
LIBEGL=/usr/lib/libEGL-sgx.so
... other magical incantations?
